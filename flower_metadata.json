The name was derived from Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (ga\u00fbros) meaning \"superb\" and named in reference to the stature and floral display of some species in this genus. The genus included many species known commonly as beeblossoms. Genetic research showed that the genus was paraphyletic unless the monotypic genus Stenosiphon is included within Gaura, increasing the number of species in the genus to 22. Gaura is now a synonym of Oenothera, with the bulk of the Gaura taxa in genus Oenothera sect. Gaura (L.) W.L.Wagner &Hoch.",
